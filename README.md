# WhatsApp Spam Detector API 🤖

A robust, rule-based API designed to detect spam in text messages, built with Python and Django, and deployed in a production-ready environment on AWS.

This project was developed as an academic requirement for the computer Science course at UECE, under the supervision of Professor Rafael Lopes Gomes.

-   **WhatsApp Webhook Integration:** Fully integrated with the Meta for Developers platform to receive and respond to WhatsApp messages in real-time.
-   **Production-Grade Deployment:** Deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using a professional-grade server stack.
-   **Interactive API Documentation:** Automatically generated and interactive API documentation powered by Swagger (drf-yasg).
